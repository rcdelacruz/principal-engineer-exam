- **Codeium** - AI code completion
- **Any other AI coding assistants**

### üìã **AI Usage Requirements**
1. **Document your AI usage** in your final submission
2. **Understand the code** - you must be able to explain all generated code
3. **Test AI-generated code** - ensure it works and follows best practices
4. **Customize AI suggestions** - don't blindly accept all suggestions

### üéØ **Evaluation Approach**
- AI usage will **not** negatively impact your evaluation
- We evaluate **final code quality** and **your understanding**, not how you created it
- During technical interviews, you'll be asked to explain your implementation decisions

## Deployment Platform Flexibility

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Platform Options**
Deploy to **any platform** of your choice:
- **AWS** (recommended) - EC2, ECS, Lambda, Amplify
- **Google Cloud Platform** - Compute Engine, Cloud Run, App Engine
- **Microsoft Azure** - App Service, Container Instances, Functions
- **Vercel** - Excellent for Next.js applications
- **Netlify** - Good for frontend deployment
- **Railway** - Simple full-stack deployment
- **Render** - Easy deployment with databases
- **DigitalOcean** - App Platform or Droplets
- **Heroku** - Simple platform-as-a-service
- **Self-hosted** - Your own servers or VPS

### üìã **Deployment Requirements**
1. **Working live deployment** accessible via URL
2. **Document your deployment process** in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. **Include deployment automation** (CI/CD pipeline)
4. **Justify your platform choice** in your architecture documentation

### üí∞ **Cost Considerations**
- Use **free tiers** when available
- We'll reimburse reasonable deployment costs (up to $50) with receipts
- Document estimated monthly costs for production scale
