## Evaluation Process

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. **Automated Checks** (GitHub Actions)
   - Code quality and linting
   - Type safety
   - Test coverage
   - Security scanning
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Manual Review**
   - Architecture design quality
   - Problem-solving approach
   - Code organization and patterns
   - Documentation completeness

3. **Live Demo** (Optional)
   - Application walkthrough
   - Architecture explanation
   - Q&A about implementation decisions

## Time Allocation Guidelines

- **Day 1 (8 hours)**: Architecture design and foundation
- **Day 2 (8 hours)**: Implementation and DevOps setup  
- **Day 3 (8 hours)**: Testing, optimization, and documentation

## Support

- Check `docs/FAQ.md` for common questions
- Review `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for setup issues
