# TechFlow - System Architecture

*[Replace this template with your actual architecture documentation]*

## System Overview

### High-Level Architecture
*[Include a diagram showing major components and their interactions]*

### Component Responsibilities
- **Web Frontend**: 
- **API Backend**: 
- **Admin Dashboard**: 
- **Database Layer**: 
- **Caching Layer**: 
- **Authentication Service**: 

## Technical Decisions

### Database Design

#### Multi-Tenant Strategy
*[Describe your approach: shared schema, separate schemas, or separate databases]*

#### Schema Overview
*[Include key entities and relationships]*

```sql
-- Example schema structure
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Design

#### REST vs GraphQL
*[Justify your choice and design approach]*

#### Authentication & Authorization
*[Describe JWT strategy, role-based access control]*

#### Rate Limiting
*[Explain rate limiting strategy per user/organization]*

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Strategy
*[Server components vs client components approach]*

#### State Management
*[Describe client-side and server-side state management]*

#### Routing Strategy
*[Explain route organization and protection]*

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
*[Describe how the system scales with increased load]*

### Database Scaling
*[Read replicas, sharding strategy, connection pooling]*

### Caching Strategy
*[Redis usage, application-level caching, CDN]*

### Load Balancing
*[Load balancer configuration and health checks]*

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
*[Encryption at rest and in transit]*

### Input Validation
*[Validation strategy and sanitization]*

### Compliance Considerations
*[GDPR, PCI DSS considerations for fintech features]*

## Performance Considerations

### Database Performance
*[Indexing strategy, query optimization]*

### Frontend Performance
*[Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization]*

### API Performance
*[Response optimization, pagination strategy]*

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Strategy
*[Structured logging, log aggregation]*

### Metrics & Alerting
*[Key metrics to monitor, alerting thresholds]*

### Health Checks
*[Application and database health check endpoints]*

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Strategy
*[Docker configuration, multi-stage builds]*

### Infrastructure as Code
*[Terraform/CDK approach, resource organization]*

### CI/CD Pipeline
*[Build, test, security, deployment stages]*

## Trade-offs & Decisions

### Technology Choices
